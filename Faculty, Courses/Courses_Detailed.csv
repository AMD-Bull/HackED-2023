MED 621 - The Art of Grant Writing,"The purpose of this course is to train graduate students in preparing grant applications in order to improve their chances of future success in obtaining research funds from a major Canadian federal funding agency such as the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. The course is targeted primarily towards students who have completed at least one year of graduate work. Preference will be given to those planning to pursue a PhD. Throughout the course, students will be instructed on how to prepare a complete grant application package on a topic that is different from their graduate project. The proposal will be prepared in stages and completed two weeks prior to the end of the semester. Students will then prepare and give presentations for a mock site visit by the funding agency. Students will also participate in a mock peer review committee and make final funding decisions. Enrolment is limited, and registration is by permission of the Department.

SPH 556 - Climate Change and Human Health,"Climate change has severe and wide-sweeping consequences for humanity with important threats to human health and wellness. With health impacts ranging from heat-related deaths to infectious diseases (e.g., waterborne, foodborne, vector borne, and zoonotic diseases) to malnutrition to mental health to health service disruption and beyond, climate change is considered one of the biggest health challenges of the 21st century. This course focuses on how climate change is already impacting our health, and how we can diminish those impacts. Students will examine how past and future climate change hazards, exposures, and vulnerabilities shape health risks. Case studies will demonstrate how health equity, intersectionality, and social determinants of health can mediate or amplify risks. Students will apply vulnerability assessment tools to identify and prioritize effective and feasible adaptation and mitigation actions. Through discussion, teamwork, and real-world examples, students will apply principles of transdisciplinary, systems thinking, equity and justice, sustainability, complexity, Indigenous Peoples' Rights, and community engagement to not only understand climate change impacts on health but to also move into the solution space.",LECTURE 850 (49862) ONLINE,No scheduled class times,Sherilee Harper
